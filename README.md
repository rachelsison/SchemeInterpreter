# SchemeInterpreter
Interpreter for the programming language Scheme

To run the program and check out the interpreter just run scheme.py in the terminal like this: 

>>> python3 scheme.py

then you will see this:

scm>

This means you are in the interpreter and you can type any valid scheme function and it will print the result.
